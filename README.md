# Brid PHP API Ver. 2.0.

You can download our API helper classes from our GIT repo here which also contains starter example files for usage. 
You just substitute your authorization token and other required parameters and you are already set up to start your custom implementation.

All examples are categorized by sections with sample PHP code for almost every possible end point the API supports.
Make sure to always substitute <YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_KEY> and other strings correctly in these examples so they match your data.
